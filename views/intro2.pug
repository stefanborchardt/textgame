		h2 Mark Shared Images

		div.w50.plus This game is about good communication. Both of you see images. Most of them are the same for both of you. 
			| Some are different. They are on different positions for each of you. Select the images you both have in common.
	
		div.w50 You can select and deselect images 
			| when it is your turn. The chat
			| is always available. The pictures will be removed when you click End Turn. You find the number of images you can select below the chat.
		
		div.w50 The less turns 
			| you take the more points 
			| you get.

		div.w50 If you had a misunderstanding and accidentally removed a difference, you get one more selection in the next turn to make up for the mistake. Some levels allow you to Undo 
			| your last turn instead, if both of you click the appropriate button. There might also be a Joker 
			| available, which removes some of the shared images - though it does not work in the last turn. 

		div.w50 Of course, bonus points are awarded when you don't use the extras.
